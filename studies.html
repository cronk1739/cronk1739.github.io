      <p id="manual-paragraph">Isaac and his mother lived in a small home, his mother a devoted christian always watching christian television. Isaac a 5 year old always drawing pictures and playing with his toys, kept mostly to himself. One day Isaac’s mother heard a voice calling out to her. The voice said “Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.”. Isaac’s mother not even questioning the voice she heard, she immediately responded “I will do my best to save him, my Lord” before immediately rushing into his room and taking anything she see’s as evil. Again she hears the familar voice saying “Isaac’s soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.”, Isaac’s mother tells this voice that she will follow his instructions. She locked isaac in his room completely away from everything. One more time the voice booms in her mind “You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.”. She listens to the voices commands, of which is to sacrifice her son to him to prove her devotion. She quickly agrees and grabs a butcher knife from the kitchen and approaches Isaac’s room. Through a crack in his door, Isaac sees his mother approaching with the knife; he begins to look around for an escape path. Just as his mother opens the door, he finds a trapdoor to the basement under his rug; quickly he jumps into it right before she strikes him, beginning the game. 

From this opening scenes, the religious themes of the game begin to make sense to the player. And as the game progresses we begin to learn more about Mom and Isaac.
