Mini Music Player

Files:
- index.html — the player UI
- style.css — styles
- app.js — player logic, visualizer, playlist handling

How to use:
- Open `newer-mini-projects/music-app/index.html` in your browser.
- Drag & drop audio files onto the page or use the file input to add files to the playlist.
- Use Play/Pause, Next/Prev, Seek, Volume. Keyboard shortcuts: Space toggles play/pause; ←/→ seek.

Notes:
- The app uses the Web Audio API and an AudioContext for the visualizer. Some browsers require a user gesture to start audio playback.
- If you want a desktop icon added, tell me where to put it and I'll wire it up to the desktop.
